## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up API keys:
   - Copy `Config.template.xcconfig` to `Config.xcconfig`
   - Get your API key from [Stability AI](https://platform.stability.ai/)
   - Replace the placeholder in `Config.xcconfig` with your actual API key
3. Build and run in Xcode

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Never commit your `Config.xcconfig` file to version control. It's already added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.

## Security Considerations

- API keys are stored locally in `Config.xcconfig` and UserDefaults
- The app uses secure HTTPS connections for all API calls
- Camera and photo library permissions are requested at runtime
- No user data is stored on remote servers
- All image processing is done through Stability AI's secure API

## Privacy

The app requires:
- Camera access for taking photos
- Photo library access for saving processed images
- Internet access for API communication

No data is collected or shared beyond what's necessary for image processing.
